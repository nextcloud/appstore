A new app store for Nextcloud apps built with Django. Up and running at [https://apps.nextcloud.com](https://apps.nextcloud.com).

We **do not handle Nextcloud integration**. Nextcloud integration is handled in the [Nextcloud Server repository](https://github.com/nextcloud/server).

## Documentation
Documentation including setup and API specification is [available on Read the Docs](https://nextcloudappstore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Contributing
If you want to help in developing the App Store, translating or filing bugs and feature requests, please consult the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/nextcloud/appstore/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Security
If you find security issues or bugs please follow the [official security process](https://nextcloud.com/security/).

The store does not offer any bug bounties but we hope that you still want to help us to fix its issues :)
