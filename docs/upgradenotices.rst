Configuring Nextcloud Release Sync
----------------------------------

**3.2.0** changed the way Nextcloud releases are managed in the App Store. Instead of manually adjusting releases in the admin interface or importing updated fixtures via JSON files releases are now synced directly from GitHub.

Consult :ref:`prod_install_release_sync` or if you are using Docker :ref:`prod_install_release_sync_docker` in order to run or configure the release sync command.
