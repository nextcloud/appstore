App Developer Guide
===================

Most of today's developers publish their source code on GitHub, BitBucket or on their own GitLab instance. These tools typically also provide a way to release new versions based on Git tags or by uploading custom archives.

Advanced users and developers typically prefer to download the app directly from these services whereas administrators or novice users look for app releases on the App Store. This means that you have to take care of publishing two releases on two different platforms.

We want to avoid duplication and make it harder to ship broken releases by mistake, therefore we went for the following solution:

* Your app's source code is hosted on GitHub or a similar service

* You should use Git tags to create new releases on these services

* If you are using GitHub, the archives that it automatically creates for releases do not match the required folders structure: expected top level folder consisting of lower case ASCII characters and underscores (see below, under Uploading an App Release) while GitHub creates APP_ID-version folder at top level. You should upload the archive to the appropriate releases page in both cases: whether you just package it with `tar czf ...` command or compilation or other transformations like minification are done to create it.

This keeps your repository up to date and satisfies the needs of developers and advanced users.

Publishing Apps on the App Store
--------------------------------
Hosting the archive on a different host means of course that we can not guarantee that the contents have not been tampered with. Neither can we guarantee that the actual app developer uploaded the app. Therefore we require you to sign your app using a certificate.

Obtaining a Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The certificates should be stored in **~/.nextcloud/certificates/** so first create the folder if it does not exist yet::

    mkdir -p ~/.nextcloud/certificates/

Then change into the directory::

    cd ~/.nextcloud/certificates/

and generate your private certificate and CSR::

    openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout APP_ID.key -out APP_ID.csr -subj "/CN=APP_ID"

Replace **APP_ID** with your app id, e.g. if your app had an id called **news** you would execute the following command::

    openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout news.key -out news.csr -subj "/CN=news"

.. note:: Keep in mind that an app id must only contain lowercase ASCII characters and underscores!

Then post the contents of your **APP_ID.csr** (e.g. **~/.nextcloud/certificates/news.csr**) on `on our certificate repository <https://github.com/nextcloud/app-certificate-requests>`_ as pull request and configure your GitHub account to show your mail address in your profile.

We might ask you for further information to verify that you're the legitimate owner of the application. Make sure to keep the private key file (**APP_ID.key**, e.g. **~/.nextcloud/certificates/news.key**) secret and not disclose it to any third-parties.

After we approved your certificate, we will post your signed public certificate (APP_ID.crt) as a response in your app's directory. Take the contents and store it in the same folder with the file name **APP_ID.crt** (e.g. **~/.nextcloud/certificates/news.crt**). Make sure to get rid of excess whitespace at the beginning and end of your file. Your public signed certificate's file contents should look similar to this::

    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

.. note:: Be sure to follow the directory and naming structure for certificates. All our documentation examples and tools will assert this structure.


.. _app-register:

Registering an App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you've obtained your signed public certificate you can use it to register your app id on the App Store. To do that either use the :ref:`REST API <api-register-app>` or use the App Store's `register app web interface <https://apps.nextcloud.com/developer/apps/new>`_.

The interface will ask you for the following things:

* **Certificate**: Paste in the contents of your public certificate, e.g. **~/.nextcloud/certificates/news.crt**
* **Signature**: A signature over your app id to verify that you own the private certificate. Can be calculated by using the following command::

    echo -n "APP_ID" | openssl dgst -sha512 -sign ~/.nextcloud/certificates/APP_ID.key | openssl base64

  where **APP_ID** is your app's id, e.g::

    echo -n "news" | openssl dgst -sha512 -sign ~/.nextcloud/certificates/news.key | openssl base64

We will then verify the certificate and signature and register you as the app's owner. You are now able to publish releases.

Uploading an App Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you've registered your app you can upload your app's releases to the App Store. To do that either use the :ref:`REST API <api-create-release>` or use the App Store's `upload app release web interface <https://apps.nextcloud.com/developer/apps/releases/new>`_.

The interface will ask you for the following things:

* **Download**: A download link to your app release archive (tar.gz)
* **Nightly**: Check if you are uploading a nightly release
* **Signature**: A signature over your release archive. Can be calculated by using the following command::

    openssl dgst -sha512 -sign ~/.nextcloud/certificates/APP_ID.key /path/to/app.tar.gz | openssl base64

  where **APP_ID** is your app's id, e.g::

    openssl dgst -sha512 -sign ~/.nextcloud/certificates/news.key /path/to/news.tar.gz | openssl base64

We then download the archive and verify the signature. In addition we try to verify and use as much information as possible form the archive, e.g.:

* The archive must only contain one top level folder consisting of lower case ASCII characters and underscores

* The archive must contain an **info.xml** file inside the **appinfo** directory which in turn is located in the top folder

* The info.xml is reformatted using XSLT to bring everything into the correct order (required for XSD 1.0) and unknown elements are dropped. Old elements are migrated to their new equivalents if possible. Afterwards we validate it using an XML Schema (see :ref:`info-schema`)

If everything went well the release is then either created or updated. The downloaded archive will be deleted from our server.

.. _app-revoke-cert:

Revoking a Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you've lost or leaked your private certificate you want to revoke your certificate.

You can revoke your previous certificate by either posting your public certificate and revocation request `on our issue tracker <https://github.com/nextcloud/appstore/issues/new>`_ or by requesting a new certificate for an already requested app id.

After you've obtained a new certificate, simply use it to register your app id again (only owners are allowed to do this). This will delete all previous releases from our server since their signature has become invalid.

Transferring Your App to a New Owner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transferring an app works similar to :ref:`registering an app <app-register>`: The new owner simply needs to register the app again using the public certificate and the signature.

However by default this is restricted to the app's owner. To disable this restriction you first need to unlock your app for the owner transfer. You can do this by going to your **account** settings and choosing `Transfer app ownership <https://apps.nextcloud.com/account/transfer-apps>`_. On that page you can lock or unlock your apps for being transferred.

After you unlocked your app for transfer, the new owner can then proceed to register the app again. If everything went fine the app is now transferred to the new owner and the transfer setting for that app is locked again.


.. _app-metadata:

App Metadata
------------

App metadata is currently being read from the **appinfo/info.xml** and **CHANGELOG.md** file.

info.xml
~~~~~~~~
The info.xml is validated using an XML Schema which can be accessed `online <https://apps.nextcloud.com/schema/apps/info.xsd>`_.

A minimum valid **info.xml** would look like this:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <info xmlns:xsi= "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://apps.nextcloud.com/schema/apps/info.xsd">

* All other Strings have a maximum of 256 characters

The following elements are either deprecated or for internal use only and will fail the validation if present:

* **standalone**
* **default_enable**
* **shipped**
* **public**
* **remote**
* **requiremin**
* **requiremax**


database.xml
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The database.xml is validated using an XML Schema which can be accessed `through the App Store <https://apps.nextcloud.com/schema/apps/database.xsd>`_.

A minimum valid **database.xml** would look like this:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <database xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
              xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://apps.nextcloud.com/schema/apps/database.xsd">
        <table>
            <name>*dbprefix*blog_articles</name>
            <declaration>

            </declaration>
        </table>
    </database>

A full blown example would look like this (needs to be utf-8 encoded):

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <database xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
              xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://apps.nextcloud.com/schema/apps/database.xsd">
        <table>
            <name>*dbprefix*blog_articles</name>

                        <name>user</name>

            </declaration>
        </table>
    </database>

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

The changelog has to be named **CHANGELOG.md** and being placed in your app's top level folder, e.g. **news/CHANGELOG.md**.

Changelogs have to follow the `Keep a CHANGELOG format <http://keepachangelog.com>`_, e.g.::

.. note:: The regex for matching the line is **^## (\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+)**, the regex for nightlies is **^## [Unreleased]**

The version has to be equal to the version in your info.xml. If the parser can't find a changelog entry, it will be set to an empty string. Only the changelog for the current release will be imported.

The changelog for nightlies will be taken from the **## [Unreleased]** block

Changelogs can be translated as well. To add a changelog for a specific translation, use **CHANGELOG.code.md**, e.g.: **CHANGELOG.fr.md**

.. _info-schema:

Schema Integration
------------------
We provide an XML schema which can be used to validate and get IDE autocompletion for the following files:

* **appinfo/info.xml**:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <info xmlns:xsi= "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
              xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://apps.nextcloud.com/schema/apps/info.xsd">

              <!-- content here -->

        </info>

* **appinfo/database.xml**:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <database xmlns:xsi= "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
              xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://apps.nextcloud.com/schema/apps/database.xsd">

              <!-- content here -->

        </database>

You can also validate your info.xml using `various online tools <http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation/>`_
