Store Documentation
===================

The documentation is built using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ and is located inside the **docs** folder.

To change the documentation it is recommended to first install all required libraries in a virtual environment. To do that follow the guide for :doc:`devinstall`.

To build the documentation change into the **docs** folder and run::

    make html

Then open the file in **_build/html/index.html** in your favorite browser.
